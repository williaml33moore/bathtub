# Bathtub

![Bathtub_Logo](docs/assets/Bathtub_Logo.png)

Bathtub is a free open-source
SystemVerilog package
based on UVM 
that brings Agile Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
and Gherkin
to the design and verification of integrated circuits,
enabling executable specifications and true living documentation.

## Pages Branch
This `pages` branch is special.
It contains the web content for Bathtub's GitHub pages.
The web content is all in the `docs/` directory.

**Do not merge `docs/` into branch `main`!**

We do not want the web content in the `main` branch en masse.
It's okay to check a few select files from `pages` into `main`, e.g. the logo.
