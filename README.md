Bathtub is a free open-source
SystemVerilog package
based on UVM 
that brings Agile Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
and Gherkin
to the design and verification of integrated circuits,
enabling executable specifications and true living documentation.

This release contains the following:

* `src/`: Bathtub source code
* `docs/`: Files that support Bathtub documentation
* `examples/`: Examples of Bathtub tests and applications

Bathtub is written in SystemVerilog and requires a full-featured SystemVerilog simulator with UVM to run.
