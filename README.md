Hello and welcome!

Bathtub was introduced in my paper "Gherkin Implementation In SystemVerilog Brings Agile Behavior-Driven Development To UVM" at [DVCon U.S. 2024](https://2024.dvcon.org).
The source code is all here and it works.
However this repo is not very user friendly at this time.
I plan to keep developing it to complete a few features that I intentionally broke when I rewrote the parser, to add user documentation, and to provide more examples.

In the meantime, feel free to have a look at [bathtub_test_paper](https://edaplayground.com/x/RiMD) on EDA Playground.
Its purpose is to validate the code samples in the paper.

I promise, more is to come!
Stay tuned and stay in touch.
