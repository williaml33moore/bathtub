Bathtub is an open-source
SystemVerilog package
based on UVM 
that brings Agile Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
and Gherkin
to the design and verification of integrated circuits,
enabling executable specifications and true living documentation.

This repo contains the following:

[Source code](https://github.com/williaml33moore/bathtub)
: The Bathtub code is available open-source under the [M.I.T. license](https://github.com/williaml33moore/bathtub/blob/main/LICENSE).
The repo is available for cloning and forking, but I don't expect to entertain pull requests until it has reached a more complete release milestone. Bathtub is written in SystemVerilog and requires a full-featured SystemVerilog simulator with UVM to run.
