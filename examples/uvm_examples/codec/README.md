# codec
The reference implementation libraries for UVM 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 include complete source code for a working verification environment for a simple parallel-to-serial codec.
We are going to apply Bathtub to that codec environment.
The purpose is to illustrate how you can apply Bathtub to any UVM testbench.

Find complete instructions on the [UVM Codec](https://github.com/williaml33moore/bathtub/wiki/UVM-Codec) Wiki page.
