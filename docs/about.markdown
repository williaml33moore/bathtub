My name is [Bill Moore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william7moore/).
I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University and have enjoyed a thirty year career in IC design and verification, working for or with over a dozen companies.
I am currently a Senior Verification Engineer with [Paradigm Works](http://paradigm-works.com).
A compulsive lifelong learner, I have a passion for finding creative solutions to technical problems, and a gift for helping teams and individuals communicate more effectively.
I live in San Jose, California--the "Capital of Silicon Valley"--with my wife and son.

In 2022 I was researching possible solutions to widespread nagging problems with documentation in IC projects, such as:
* Static and stale documentation
* Documentation that's asynchronous with implementation
* Documentation and source code created and maintained on separate systems
* Rich formatting that makes automation and reuse difficult
* Technical language barriers between writers and readers from different disciplines

I discovered living documentation and BDD and was intrigued and also a little jealous because as a SystemVerilog enthusiast, I felt left out.
So I ported Gherkin to SystemVerilog at my previous employer, [Everactive](https://everactive.com), and got it working on a limited experimental basis on our current project at that time.
I don't work there anymore but before I left, they were gracious enough to release Bathtub as [open-source software](https://github.com/everactive/bathtub) so I could continue to develop it and share it with the design verification community.
I published a paper on Bathtub and presented it at [DVCon U.S. 2024](https://dvcon.org), the premier conference for IC design and verification professionals, and to my joy it won the third place [Stuart Sutherland Best Paper](https://dvcon.org/press-release-march-20-2024) award!

I have tons of plans for this tool and I'm excited to be on this adventure.
