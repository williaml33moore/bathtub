Hi! Welcome! Let me catch you up.

My name is Bill and I've been an IC design and verification engineer in Silicon Valley for 30 years.
In 2022 I discovered living documentation and decided to port BDD to SystemVerilog and UVM.
The result is Bathtub.

(I'm using a lot of jargon here without defining it. Most of it is introduced in the [About]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/) page.)

In 2023 I decided to write a paper proposal about Bathtub and submit it to [DVCon U.S.](https://dvcon.org) 2024 for publication.
I've attended DVCon for the past ten years and this was my first time submitting anything.
The proposal was accepted so I spent the autumn and winter weekends and holidays finishing the paper and all the presentation deliverables.
It was much tougher than I anticipated, especially since I chose to spend some of that precious time rewriting a major part of the code.
Then I struggled with serious writer's block while trying to start the paper.
By some miracle though I made all the deadlines, some with literally minutes left.

March 6 the big day finally arrived and I delivered my presentation.
Everything went as well as I could have hoped and I was profoundly honored to win the third place [Stuart Sutherland Best Paper](https://2024.dvcon.org/press-release-march-20-2024) award!

Bathtub has been open-source since 2023 but quietly so. I knew all along that I was going to need to share the GitHub repo, so I scrambled to get it cleaned up for company.
A bare repo isn't very inviting, so after presentation day, I focused on bringing up this GitHub pages web site.
That was a whole struggle because I'm new to GitHub and its pages workflow, but it's finally coming together.

And that's where we are today. Paper's done, repo's ready, web site's open.

Come on in. I'm glad you're here.
