Things are moving quickly!

I've been invited to present my Bathtub talk at [Design Verification Club (DVClub)](http://dvclub.org) this week, not once, but twice!

DVClub is a series of lunch-and-learn events held a few times per year in cities around the U.S.
This week's editions are in San Jose, CA on Wednesday, Mar 27, 2024 and in Portland, OR on Thursday, Mar 28.
(Actually they're in Milpitas and Hillsboro, but if you go, you know.)
DVClub is different from [DVCon](https://dvcon.org), which is an annual weeklong conference in locations around the world.
I attended DVClub regularly over the years, but this is my first time back in person since the pandemic.

At both of this week's programs, I'm especially pleased to be joining the inimitable Cliff Cummings from [Sunburst Design](http://sunburst-design.com).
Cliff is renowned throughout the semiconductor industry for his essential training courses, his dozens of influential and award-winning papers and presentations at key conferences, and his contributions to and deep knowledge of the IEEE Verilog, SystemVerilog, and UVM standards we rely on every day.
I met Cliff over ten years ago and indeed took his Sunburst Design SystemVerilog Fundamentals and SystemVerilog OVM/UVM Verification Training courses in Santa Clara, CA.
This Bathtub work I do today is built on the solid foundation I got from Cliff those many years ago.
(Is it wise to build on a Cliff? Yes, as long as it's Cummings and not Goings!)

Cliff's talk will be, "The Untapped Power of UVM Resources and Why Engineers Should Use the uvm_resource_db API."
I was there when he delivered this excellent presentation last year at DVCon U.S. 2023, and during it I literally opened up my laptop to check my Bathtub code to make sure I was using the UVM resource database correctly!

Full disclosure: Cliff and I both work for [Paradigm Works](http://paradigm-works.com), which sponsors and organizes DVClub. Sunburst Design merged with Paradigm Works in 2020, adding world-class training to Paradigm's arsenal of IC expert design and verification services.

Now, I've known Michael Hoyt, the CEO of Paradigm Works, for over _twenty-five_ years.
He recruited me into Mint Technology way back then, and I cherish memories of helping him build up the Silicon Valley office from little more than scratch.
Since then we've worked together off and on several times as career paths meander.
Michael and Cliff were both at DVCon this year and it was great to catch up with them, and I'm looking forward to having more time to hang out this week. 

You can register for DVClub [here](http://dvclub.org/register/).
Chances are it our talks have already passed by the time you read this, but you can sign up to be notified of future events.
